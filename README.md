# JavaScript Projects #
This repo holds a variety of projects all written in plain (vanilla) JavaScript, HTML and CSS, and with minimal use of libraries,  frameworks or dependencies. The objective here is to explore the potential of foundational, close-to-the-metal technologies, improve my craft and experiment with novel syntax and features.. The inspiration for these projects has come from multiple sources, including job interview challenges, tutorials, and my own imagination. In some cases I refactor work I have done in React or Node, to arrive at the same functionality without those libraries.
