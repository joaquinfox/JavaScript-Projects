# JavaScript Projects #
This repo holds games, snippets, exercises and random creations all written in plain (vanilla) JavaScript, HTML and CSS. These projects make minimal use of libraries,  frameworks or dependencies as a way of exploring the potential of these close-to-the-metal technologies. The inspiration for these projects has come from multiple sources, including job interviews, tutorials, and my own imagination. In some cases I refactor work I have done in React or Node, to arrive at the same functionality without those libraries.
  
My purpose is to improve my craft and experiment
with novel syntax and features.
