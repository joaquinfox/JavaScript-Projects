# JavaScript Projects #
This repo holds games, snippets, exercises and random creations all written
in plain (vanilla) JavaScript, HTML and CSS. There are no libraries, frameworks or dependencies.
The inspiration for these projects has come from multiple sources, including job interviews,
tutorials, and my own imagination. In some cases I refactor work I have done in React or Node,
to arrive at the same functionality without those libraries.
  
My purpose is to explore the potential of these close-to-the-metal technologies, improve my craft and experiment
with novel syntax or features.
