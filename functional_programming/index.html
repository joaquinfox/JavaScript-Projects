    <h4>Higher Order Functions are ...</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Easier to read</li>
      <li>Easier to re-use</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Functional programming let's us create anonymous functions and pass them
      around, so we can go from something like this ...
    </p>
    <code>
      function triple(x){
      <br />
      return x * 3
      <br />
      }
    </code>
    <p>to something more like this ...</p>
    <code>
      let triple = function(x){
      <br />
      return x * 3
      <br />
      }
    </code>
    <p>
      In the example above, the triple function is expressed as a variable,
      which allows us to use it in other places, and mix it in with other
      operations. Which leads us to ...
    </p>

    <h4>Composition</h4>
    <p>
      By assigning functions to variables, we can pass them, connect them, and
      nest them so as to make big operations simpler, more readable and easier
      to debug.
    </p>
    <p>
      Higher order functions accept <em>callback functions</em>. Callback
      functions are functions you stuff inside of other functions, so that they
      can perform some subsidiary task. This structure is an example of
      composition, where we have a higher order function with a callback
      function. The callback function does some operation that is part of the
      larger task of the higher order function.
    </p>
    <p>Suppose we are given the following data, an array of objects</p>
    <code>
      const animals = [
      <br />
      { name:'fluffy', species:'cat'},
      <br />
      { name:'dingo', species:'crododile'},
      <br />

      { name:'Issabel', species:'camel'},
      <br />

      { name:'JimBob', species:'cat'},
      <br />

      { name:'Ceasar', species:'cat'},
      <br />

      { name:'Cerebrum', species:'parrot'},
      <br />

      { name:'Trump', species:'rabbit'},
      <br />

      { name:'George Washington', species:'dog'},
      <br />
      ]
    </code>
    <p>
      Say we want to extract cats from this list. Here is a
      <em>procedural</em> way of accomplishing that.
    </p>
    <code>
      const cats=[]
      <br />
      function getCats(animals){
      <br />
      for(let i = 0; i < animals.length;i++){
      <br />
      if(animals[i].species === 'cat'){
      <br />
      cats.push(animals[i])
      <br />
      }
      <br />
      }
      <br />
      return cats
      <br />
      }
      <br />
    </code>
    <p>
      Now let's do the same thing using the higher order function
      <em>filter</em>
    </p>
    <code>
      let cats = animals.filter(animal=>{
      <br />
      animal.species === 'cat'
      <br />
      })
    </code>
    <p>
      We can use composition to stream line and clarify our logic even further
    </p>
    <code>
      let isCat = (animal)=>{ return animal.species === 'cat'}
      <br />
      let cats = animals.filter(isCat)
    </code>
    <h4>Map</h4>
    <p>Let's extract the names from the array animals,</p>
    <p>A procedural method could be something like this:</p>
    <code>
      let names =[];
      <br />
      for(let i = 0; i < animals.length;i++){
      <br />
      names.push(animals[i].name);
      <br />
      }
    </code>
    <p>Now let's use Map</p>
    <code> let names = animals.map(animal => animal.name); </code>
    <h4>Summary of higher order functions</h4>
    <p>
      All the functions below take a list and a callback function and return the
      list transformed into something else.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Map</strong> will take an array, transform it and return an
        array <em>of the same length.</em>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Filter & Reject</strong> will take an array, transform it and
        return a <em>smaller array.</em>
        <p>
          I don't see a use case for reject where filter cannot be used instead.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Find</strong> works like filter, but only returns
        <em>a single item</em> (the first matching item it finds).
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Reduce</h4>
    <p>
      Reduce is the multi tool of higher order functions. It can perform
      <em>any</em> of the transformations other functions (i.e map, filter and
      find) can perform.
    </p>
    <p>reduce is of the general form</p>
    <code>array.reduce((callback,[starterValue])</code>
    <p>
      ... where the <em>starterValue</em> is the object type we want to end up
      with, (for example, if we want to end up with a type Number, we could use
      0, or if we want to end up with an object we can use {}).
    </p>
    <p>
      The callback functin takes two arguments, and they can be called anything,
      but they are referred to generically as the <em>accumulator</em> and the
      <em>current</em>. Our reduce function starts to look something like this:
    </p>
    <code>
      array.reduce((accumulator, current)=> {callback}, starterValue)
    </code>
    <p>
      The <em>accumulator</em> will hold the final value we are trying to get
      to. The <em>current</em> is the object we are iterating over to get to the
      accumulator.
    </p>
    <p>
      For example, let's sum the numbers in the array [1,2,3]. Using reduce, we
      can write
    </p>
    <code>
      let array = [1,2,3];
      <br />
      array.reduce((accumulator, curent)=> accumulator + current, 0)
    </code>
    <p>
      Above, the accumulator is a bucket into which we sum the values of each
      <em>curent</em> element, and the current elements are the array elements.
      The starterValue here of 0
